## Challenges
We had difficulties uploading pictures to handlebar and eventually found out that files are already mapped to public folder which the route should omit. Getting the parallax background works perfectly with a mobile responsive flex also consumes a lot of our time. Restful API routes is the part we focus most to test with especially having it work over the authentication after a user logged in. Nevertheless, git merging conflict is still happening close to the end of our project. Overall, it was a fun project and the best thing is to have a team that communicate well and have each duties done.
